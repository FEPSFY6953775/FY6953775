    <h1>Rotary Vane Internal Combustion Engines</h1>
  </header>

  <main id="page-content">
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Rotary vane internal combustion engines are a promising technology that could provide a huge efficiency boost compared to conventional piston engines for cars. Current research shows they could be a suitable replacement but current engineering challenges such as sealing, durability and commercialisation stand in the way. Further development of this technology however could revolutionise the automotive industry and become standard in mass market vehicles.<sup>[1][2][3][4]</sup>
    </p>
 <main id="page-content">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
    Conventional engines use a 2 or 4 stroke process where a piston oscillates up and down within a cylinder combusting a mixture of air and fuel to convert chemical energy to mechanical work. The pistons link to a crankshaft to convert the vertical motion into rotation. This process has many inefficiencies such as vibration from masses moving up and down at high speedand energy wastage from converting vertical motion to a rotation and friction within the cylinder. Rotary vane engines convert the chemical energy straight into rotation by placing the combustion chambers about a central crankshaft.<sup>[3][5][6][1]</sup>
    </p>

    <h2>Operating principle</h2>
    <p>
     A rotary vane engine typically consists of a cylindrical housing, a rotor containing sliding vanes and intake and exhaust ports within the housing. The rotor is slightly off centre from the housing so as it rotates the vanes slide radially and the chambers vary in volume allowing the four phases – intake, compression, combustion and exhaust. Due to each chamber being in a different phase of rotation multiple combustion reactions can take place per rotation as opposed to one cycle every four rotations in a regular piston engine. This allows a higher frequency of power strokes and therefore higher power and smoother torque delivery.<sup>[2][7][8][1]</sup>
    </p>

    <h2>Claimed advantages</h2>
    <p>Researchers of rotary vane engines cite many theoretical and experimental advantages compared to conventional piston engines.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Power density and compactness:</strong> The high number of combustion reactions per revolution, combined with a compact circular housing, can generate high power to weight and power to volume ratios for a given displacement. This is beneficial as the engines will take up less space allowing more room for other technologies or making cars lighter and further increasing efficiency. <sup>[4][7][1][2]</sup>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mechanical simplicity and friction reduction:</strong> The removal of a slider crank mechanism, connecting rodsand a conventional valvetrain reduces the number of parts and can reduce mechanical losses and potentially increase thermal efficiency. Fewer parts may also result in lower manufacture and maintenance costs over time benefitting both the manufacturer and consumer. <sup>[2][3][5]</sup>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Smoothness:</strong> Because the main moving components rotate about a central point, rotary vane engines show low vibration and noise levels, sometimes even comparable to an electric motor. This is beneficial as reduced noise in the car provides a better driving experience as well as the reduction in wear caused by heavy vibration over time. <sup>[7][3]</sup>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Some rotary vane concepts also allow use of different fuels to petrol or diesel which could result in further reduced emissions and more sustainable transport into the future. Some designs have been tested and ran only on compressed air further increasing the flexabliltiy of this technology.<sup>[10][4]</sup>
    </p>

    <h2>Limitations and challenges</h2>
    <p>Despite all of these potential advantages there are still many potential engineering issues with current designs that make vane engines difficult to make commercially viable at the moment.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Sealing and wear:</strong> Maintaining a tight enough seal between the vane tips and the housingand between adjacent chambers, under high temperature and pressure is difficult. Poor sealing results in blow by (gases escaping to different chambers), loss of efficiencyand increased emissions, whilst if the seal is too tight, loads on the vanes can increase wear. Ensuring enough lubrication without excessive oil consumption is also challenging, as seen historically with other rotary engines. <sup>[10][6][2]</sup>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Thermal management and materials:</strong> The vanes and housing are exposed continuously to hot combustion gases, constant changing temperature may result in distortion of components. Distortion may change clearances and sealing, demanding tight machining tolerances and advanced materials or coatings, which increase cost and manufacturing complexity. <sup>[8][9][2]</sup>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Combustion control and emissions:</strong> Achieving reliable combustion, stable ignitionand low emissions across the full speed load range of an engine cycle is difficult in the irregular geometry of vane chambers. Experimental rotary vane prototypes have reported issues such as misfiring and cold start problems, especially when optimized for vapours of fuels. Meeting modern emission regulations would require sophisticated fuel injection, ignition controland exhaust treatment systems comparable to those used on advanced piston engines. <sup>[11][4][2]</sup>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Rotary vane engines lack long term production experience and optimization that has been invested in piston engines so reliability, durability and cost are unproven and may take time to catch up. Manufacturers are reluctant to adopt an entirely new technology without significant proof of the benefits due to high costs and already investing large amounts of time and money in the shift towards electric powertrains.<sup>[6][3][11]</sup>
    </p>

    <h2>Current state and potential</h2>
    <p>
      Recent work on rotary vane engines includes patents for new internal combustion configurations, small scale prototypesand machines such as low speed rotary vane pumps and expanders. One hybrid pneumatic rotary vane engine was built and tested on gasoline and LPG to supply about 1 kW of electrical power, demonstrating proof of concept but at a scale much smaller than typical piston engines. Other proposals target specialized markets such as military vehicles, aircraft, drones, or high performance sports cars, where high power density and compactness can make possible development challenges worth it. <sup>[12][9][1][4][2]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      For mainstream passenger cars, any replacement of piston engines must match or surpass them in efficiency, emissions compliance, reliability, lifetime cost and compatibility with existing powertrain and fuel infrastructure. Rotary vane engines are promising in areas such as power density and mechanical simplicity but are still behind in demonstrated long term durability, emissions performance and manufacturing ease. Rotary vane engines are a technology that has the potential to revolutionise automotive powertrains providing they can prove their long term benefits over existing and future technologies. <sup>[1][4][10][6][11][2]</sup>
