    <p>
      Rotary vane internal combustion engines are a promising technology that could provide a huge efficiency boost compared to conventional piston engines for cars<a href="#references"> (Anatoli Stanetsky, 2021)</a>. Current research shows they could be a suitable replacement providing improved efficiency, reduced noise, greater power and torque delivery and cheaper maintenance<a href="#references"> (European Patent Office, 2021)(Natalia Galin, 2021)</a>, but current engineering challenges such as sealing, durability and commercialisation stand in the way. Further development of this technology however could revolutionise the automotive industry and become standard in mass market vehicles. If companies are willing to invest time and money in research and development into rotary vane engines they could even out perform electric motors in sustainability and perfomance<a href="#references"> (Stanislaw Szwaja and Kazimierz Rzadkosz, 2018)</a>. Due to the lack of evidence of these advantages however, there is reluctance to spend the required time and money into developing these engines.<sup>[1][2][3][4]</sup>
    </p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p id = "introductionText"> 
    Conventional engines use a 2 or 4 stroke process where a piston oscillates up and down within a cylinder combusting a mixture of air and fuel to convert chemical energy to mechanical work<a href="#references"> (Natalia Galin, 2021)</a>. The pistons link to a crankshaft to convert the vertical motion into rotation. This process has many inefficiencies such as vibration from masses moving up and down at high speedand energy wastage from converting vertical motion to a rotation and friction within the cylinder. Rotary vane engines convert the chemical energy into mechanical work straight through a similar combustion process but the pressure is forced upon the sliding vanes causing the centre to rotate which directly spins the crankshaft<a href="#references"> (Del Simpson, 1977)</a> and no energy is wasted converting vertical movement to rotation and friction is reduced as touching surfaces are reduced<a href="#references"> (Anatoli Stanetsky, 2021)</a>.<sup>[3][5][1]</sup>
    </p>

    <h2 id="operating-principle">Operating principle</h2>
    <p id = "principalText">
     A rotary vane engine typically consists of a cylindrical housing, a rotor containing sliding vanes and intake and exhaust ports within the housing<a href="#references"> (European Patent Office, 2021)</a>. The rotor is slightly off centre from the housing so as it rotates the vanes slide radially and the chambers vary in volume allowing the four phases – intake, compression, combustion and exhaust<a href="#references"> (Driving 4 Answers, 2024)</a>. Due to each chamber being in a different phase of rotation multiple combustion reactions can take place per rotation<a href="#references"> (Athanassios Nassikas, 1998)</a> as opposed to one cycle every four rotations in a regular piston engine. This allows at least one power phase per rotation, 4x higher than a piston engine, which provides a near constant supply of power to the crankshaft and therefore smoother torque delivery and greater efficiency (Anatoli Stanetsky, 2021).<sup>[2][7][8][1]</sup>
    </p>

    <h2 id="claimed-advantages">Claimed advantages</h2>
    <p id = "advantagesText">
      Researchers of rotary vane engines cite many theoretical and experimental advantages compared to conventional piston engines such as an increased power to weight ratio, friction reduction and increased smoothness of torque delivery.</p>
    <ul id = "advantagesText3">
      <li>
        <strong>Power density and compactness:</strong> The high number of combustion reactions per revolution, combined with a compact circular housing, can generate high power to weight and power to volume ratios for a given displacement. This is beneficial as the engines will take up less space allowing more room for other technologies or making cars lighter and further increasing efficiency as well as increasing the power provided to the crankshaft and smoother torque delivery.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mechanical simplicity and friction reduction:</strong> The removal of a slider crank mechanism, connecting rods and a conventional valve train reduces the number of parts and can reduce mechanical losses and potentially increase thermal efficiency. Fewer parts may also result in lower manufacture and maintenance costs over time as less joints results in less wear, benefitting both the manufacturer and consumer.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Smoothness:</strong> Because the main moving components rotate about a central point, rotary vane engines show low vibration and noise levels, sometimes even comparable to an electric motor. This is beneficial as reduced noise in the car provides a quieter driving experience as well as the reduction in wear caused by heavy vibration over time.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p id = advantagesText2>
      Some rotary vane concepts also allow use of different fuels to petrol or diesel which could result in further reduced emissions and more sustainable transport into the future (Physics Forums, 2012). Some designs have been tested and ran only on compressed air which is the most sustainable fuel source (Stanislaw Szwaja and Kazimierz Rzadkosz, 2018) and would further reduce the cost of transportation onto the future An alternative sustainable power source will mean there is no need to mine lithium for car batteries.<sup>[10][4]</sup>
    </p>

    <h2 id="limitations-challenges">Limitations and challenges</h2>
    <p id = "challengesText">
      Despite all of these potential advantages there are still many potential engineering issues with current designs that make vane engines difficult to make commercially viable at the moment such as sealing issues, material distortion and combustion control. These limitations are also creating a reluctance for more companies to invest time and money into researching these engines, slowing their development and reducing the incentive to adopt them.</p>
    <ul id = "challengesText3">
      <li>
        <strong>Sealing and wear:</strong> Maintaining a tight enough seal between the vane tips and the housingand between adjacent chambers, under high temperature and pressure is difficult. Poor sealing results in blow by (gases escaping to different chambers), loss of efficiencyand increased emissions, whilst if the seal is too tight, loads on the vanes can increase wear. Other types of rotary engines have also been historically poor with oil comsumption as large amounts must be injected directly into the combustion chambers to lubricate the vanes agaisnt the outer housing which is required to prevent excessive wear of parts.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Thermal management and materials:</strong> The vanes and housing are exposed continuously to hot combustion gases, during different stages of combustion temperatures greatly vary which can result in warping and deformation of parts over time. Distortion may change clearances and sealing, demanding tight machining tolerances and advanced materials or coatings, which increase cost and manufacturing complexity.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Combustion control and emissions:</strong> Achieving reliable combustion, stable ignitionand low emissions across the full speed load range of an engine cycle is difficult in the irregular geometry of vane chambers. Experimental rotary vane prototypes have reported issues such as misfiring and cold start problems, especially when optimized for vapours of fuels. Meeting modern emission regulations would require sophisticated fuel injection, ignition controland exhaust treatment systems comparable to those used on advanced piston engines.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p id = "challengesText2">
      Rotary vane engines lack long term production experience and optimization that has been invested in piston engines so reliability, durability and cost are unproven and may take time to catch up<a href="#references"> (Natalia Galin, 2021), (Simon Hancocks, 2025)</a>. Manufacturers are reluctant to adopt an entirely new technology without significant proof of the benefits due to high costs, especially when many companies have already invested large amounts of time and money in the shift towards electric powertrains.<sup>[3][11]</sup>
    </p>

    <h2 id="current-state">Current state and potential</h2>
    <p id = "stateText">
      Recent work on rotary vane engines includes patents for new internal combustion configurations, small scale prototypes and machines such as low speed rotary vane pumps and expanders. One hybrid pneumatic rotary vane engine was built and tested on gasoline and LPG to supply about 1 kW of electrical power<a href="#references"> (Fabio Fatigati, 2022), (Anarghya Ananda Murthy, 2024)</a>, demonstrating proof of concept but at a scale much smaller than typical piston engines. Other proposals target specialized markets such as military vehicles, aircraft, drones, or high performance sports cars<a href="#references"> (Anatoli Stanetsky, 2021)</a>, where high power density and compactness can make possible development challenges worth the costs they come with. <sup>[12][9][1]</sup>
    </p>
    <p id = "stateText2">
      For mainstream passenger cars, any replacement of piston engines must match or surpass them in efficiency, emissions compliance, reliability, lifetime cost and compatibility with existing powertrain and fuel infrastructure. Rotary vane engines are promising in areas such as power density and mechanical simplicity but are still behind in demonstrated long term durability, emissions performance and manufacturing ease. Rotary vane engines are a technology that has the potential to revolutionise automotive powertrains providing they can prove their long term benefits over existing and future technologies, otherwise they may be simply brushed over as a technology that never worked to its potential.
