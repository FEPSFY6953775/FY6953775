      Rotary vane internal combustion engines are a promising but still experimental alternative to conventional piston engines for cars, offering potential benefits in compactness, smoothness, and efficiency but facing significant engineering challenges in sealing, durability, emissions, and commercialization. Current research and patents show that while rotary vane concepts can in principle replace piston engines in some automotive roles, further development and validation are needed before they become practical replacements in mass‑market vehicles.<sup>[1][2][3][4]</sup>
    </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Conventional automotive powertrains are dominated by four‑stroke reciprocating piston engines, which convert chemical energy in fuel into mechanical work through repetitive up‑and‑down motion of pistons linked to a crankshaft. This mechanism is mature and robust but involves many moving parts, friction losses in the slider‑crank and valvetrain, and vibration due to reciprocating masses. Rotary vane engines attempt to address these limitations by using rotating vanes in a cylindrical housing to generate torque directly, removing the slider‑crank mechanism and potentially simplifying the engine.<sup>[3][5][6][1]</sup>
    </p>

    <h2>Operating principle</h2>
    <p>
      A rotary vane internal combustion engine typically consists of a circular or cylindrical housing, a rotor carrying multiple sliding vanes, and ports for intake and exhaust. As the rotor turns, the vanes slide radially to maintain contact with the housing, forming variable‑volume chambers where the four thermodynamic strokes—intake, compression, combustion/expansion and exhaust—occur in sequence around the circumference. Because several chambers can be in different phases simultaneously, multiple combustion events per revolution are possible, giving a high frequency of power strokes relative to shaft speed.<sup>[2][7][8][1]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      One patented rotary vane engine design claims that with two vanes per rotor, four working cycles per revolution are achieved, making it equivalent in indicated cycles to an eight‑piston four‑stroke engine of similar displacement. Other concepts use four intersecting vanes or multiple rotors to further increase the number of expansion events per revolution, aiming for higher specific power and smoother torque delivery. These architectures share the common feature that all principal moving elements rotate about fixed axes, which can reduce vibration compared with reciprocating pistons.<sup>[5][8][9][1][2][3]</sup>

    <h2>Claimed advantages</h2>
    <p>Proponents of rotary vane engines cite several advantages compared with conventional automotive piston engines.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Power density and compactness:</strong> The high number of combustion events per revolution, combined with a compact circular housing, can yield high power‑to‑weight and power‑to‑volume ratios for a given displacement, which is attractive where packaging space is limited, such as sports cars, drones or hybrid range extenders.<sup>[4][7][1][2]</sup>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mechanical simplicity and friction reduction:</strong> The absence of a slider‑crank mechanism, connecting rods and a conventional valvetrain reduces part count and can lower mechanical and pumping losses, potentially increasing brake thermal efficiency.<sup>[2][3][5]</sup>
